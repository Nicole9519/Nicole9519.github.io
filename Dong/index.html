        <h1>IS AIRBNB REALLY THE PROBLEM?</h1>
        <h2> The new Airbnb regulation was supposed to ease the housing crunch in Boston. The data leaves room for doubt.</h2>
          
        <p>Earlier this year, the Boston City Council overwhelmingly approved tough new restrictions on short-term rentals offered by companies like Airbnb. Starting in 2019, Boston will restrict Airbnb hoping to control rising rents, following similar laws in New York, Miami, San Francisco and other big cities. The measure eliminates investor-owned units -- homeowners have to register with the city and pay an annual fee to rent out entire unit that is either a host’s primary residence or is part of an owner-occupied two- or three-family building-- from the marketplace while allowing owner-occupied, two- and three-family homeowners to rent out their units year-round.  </p>
          
          
        <p> There certainly is an affordable housing problem here. Boston is the seventh most expensive city in the world for housing costs, according to  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-04/home-cost-index-says-ouch-hong-kong-oh-canada-hello-dubai">a recent Bloomberg analysis</a>. The median one-bedroom rent in Boston is $2,300 a month, and the two-bedroom median is $2,700. Both are more than roughly twice the national medians of $1,185 for a one-bedroom and $1,422 for a two-bedroom.</p>

    
        <p> Supporters of the new regulations argue that rental prices have been driven up and the affordable housing reduced in Boston because some landlords turned long-term rentals into short-term rentals like Airbnb. In a certain area like Chinatown, where short-term rental was pushing out long-term residents, residents have been fighting for a regulation for a long time. “It's become a huge industry that's actually eating up a lot of the housing in the city,” says Lydia Lowe, the executive director of the Chinatown Community Land Trust.</p>

        <h2>Is Airbnb overblown? </h2>
        <p>“Profits are significantly lower than many expect suggesting units are vacant more than expected.” says Arun in “The Sharing Economy”. According to AirDNA MarketMinder, Airbnb hosts could earn $5787 a month in Back Bay in September 2018, but in January they could just earn $2007 a month and even $1456 in Chinatown and the occupancy rate is just 50% and 34%. People would think twice before turning long-term rentals into short term, because of other cleaning, facility fees, and time-cost.</p>

         <p>Since 2000, rents in Boston kept climbing 2%-3% every year. There’s no sign that Airbnb accelerates the rents increasing rate.</p>

        <p>While one standard deviation - … - increase in Airbnb listings is associated with the fact that rents are going up by 0.4%,, the author Mark Materan wrote in ‘Is home sharing driving up rents? Evidence from Airbnb in Boston’ in 2015, “Airbnb is surely just a small part of it.” He said in 2018.</p>

        <p>According to data collected from Airbnb Insider, an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows you to explore how Airbnb is being used in cities around the world, from 2015-2018, there’s a little or no direct relationship between the increasing number of Airbnb and rising rents. 254 homes were added in the Airbnb website in Back Bay while 125 in Chinatown and 178 in East Boston during the four years, the rents in Back Bay only increased $35 while $370 in Chinatown and $194 in East Boston. </p>

        <p>“The rent in Boston is determined by supply and demand,” says Mark Materan, “supply like how much land can be developed and demand like how many jobs there are and how much money people can spend on rents really matter. “</p>

        <p>Being as an international center for higher learning, Boston is the location for 35 colleges, universities, and community colleges and 95,824 students housed off campus and 36,284 students housed in Boston, according to ‘Housing a changing city’ report by Martin.J Walsh, which increased the housing demand in Boston aggressively.</p>

        <p>“Boston is such a city that has been built to attract people to come in, like lots of universities and major companies, and its house is not affordable at all for a long time, not just because of us,” Lucian said, who started his work in Bulfinch Realty as an Airbnb host since 2016.</p>

        <p>In this regard, the rising rents in long-popular neighborhoods in Boston also pushed younger renters out to towns far away from the downtown area where they, in turn, are also driving up prices. That’s why rents increased far faster in neighborhoods such as Dorchester and Mattapan than in areas closer to downtown.</p>

        <p>Besides, though the government are trying to create as much as affordable housing, it’s still less than we need. Demand for affordable housing still far outstrips supply. In September, Mayor Marty Walsh's office released a revised version of its report, "Housing A Changing City: Boston 2030." The plan increases the city's goal for new housing creation to 69,000 units by the year 2030, up from its original goal in 2014 of 53,000 units. </p>

        <p>According to the data from Airbnb Insider, 88 percent of Airbnb hosts in the City of Boston rented out 2 units or fewer. This supports the Airbnb company line that the majority of users are average joes renting out their homes. The other 12% of hosts, however, listed from 3 to 320 units. They were responsible for 52 percent of all the listings in the city.</p>

        <p>As wee can see,</p>


        <p>Besides, what astonished people is that hosts with more than 5 listings made up 4 percent of all operators in the city but controlled more than 43 percent of the listings. In Boston, the biggest player is Sonder and most of the revenue are floating to them. (not sure to include or not)</p>

        <p>Lucian, a realty manager in bulfinch realty based in Boston, runs 4 Airbnb listings now. He began his business in 2016, seeing the potential opportunity brought by such a gig economy. “Airbnb is a much effective way for people to rent their apartments to strangers,” said Lucian, ”and it also a good way for tourists to explore the authenticity of districts. ” </p>

        <p>After being an Airbnb host, Lucian’s revenue doubled, especially in the summer, from late May to early October, the most attractive season in Boston. “The city on the stage should be looking to just levy us the hospitality tax, like they do to any hotels and use the revenue to create more housing, which was one of the issues or one of the reasons for this new law,” said Lucian, “but this is a free market.”</p>

        <p>Besides, the competition between Airbnb and traditional hotels is intensifying. A research shows that in the 10 cities with the largest Airbnb market share in the US, the entry of Airbnb resulted in 1.3 percent fewer hotel nights booked and a 1.5 percent loss in hotel revenue. During the summer in Boston, the average hotel price is more than $300, while Airbnb offers more apartments in the different price ranges. “The government is actually helping the hotel industry. Airbnb offers more affordable housing for tourists and business travelers.” said Lucian.</p>

        <p>Though the new regulation is aiming to eliminate the deep-pocket investor, the changes could be even harder to Airbnb hosts. “My short-term rentals are my retirement income, augment my long-term care assisted living insurance, and allow me to continue living in a neighborhood that I have been supporting and creating, since I first moved here in 1978,” said Edward, who has been an Airbnb host since 2013 and has since had over 1,000 bookings. </p>

        <p>“I’ll be stopping two of them since I can’t do them legally. It’s a huge financial loss for me so I’m cutting back expenses and my cleaner is looking for work.” said Tiffany, who is a single mom, runs her and her friend’s homes as Airbnb. “Actually, I'd feel okay to pay the tax, but why the government does not find out who is the investor? It’s not much difficult. ”</p>
      


        <h2>The backlash against Airbnb are spreading</h2>
        <p>Since Airbnb first launched in 2008 in San Francisco, it spreads aggressively in lots of major cities in America and shows no sign of slowing down. In 2006, there are 46000 Airbnb listings in New York and 26000 in Los Angeles, rising into the top ten cities with the highest number of Airbnb properties available. As a growing chorus is arguing that Airbnb turned lots of long-term rentals into short- term rentals, which driving up rental prices for city residents, San Francisco, New York and a host of other pricey cities are implementing or considering regulations.</p>

        <p>San Francisco is one of the priciest cities in the U.S. and began to limited Airbnb in February 2015, the city passed the law that hosts present during home-stays can lease rooms year round and require them to be registered. However, rents kept going up and hit a $4500 threshold. Population growth in San Francisco due to the tech industry and difficult process to get new housing approved are two main reasons for its high rental price.</p>

        <p>Besides, Santa Monica also instituted the toughest regulation on short-term rentals in the U.S. in 2015. The new regulation require anyone putting a listing on Airbnb in Santa Monica to live on the property during the renter’s stay, register for a business license and collect a 14% occupancy tax from users that will be payable to the city.</p>
        <p>The city estimates that this will shut down about 1,400 of the 1,700 short-term rental listings - about 80 percent - in this upscale beach town and major tourist destination, population about 92,500, according to a Forbes report. However, rents shows no sign of slowing down in Santa Monica and still keep rocketing. </p>

          <p>Though the Airbnb rules went into effect in many cities, there’s little evidence showing that the decrease of Airbnb listings could cool down the rents, not even stall the increase of rents. We should still hold a conservative opinion on whether the new regulation in boston will help with the rental crunch or not. </p>

          <p>It is a crisis of housing affordability and availability in Boston that has enormous impacts on individuals and families. Though the investor units may be reduced after the new regulation come out, who can guarantee that these units are going to become affordable that they will go to long-term tenants? It remains to be seen if the rules will have their intended effect.</p>
