		  <h1>Snowy January in Massachusetts</h1>
		  	<h2>When bombogenesis comes</h2>

		  <div id = "text1">
		  <p>
		  	In January 2018, a strong storm headed straight for Massachusetts, causing extreme weather and heavy snow. <br /><br />
		  	But how did it distribute to different counties in MA? And which county have the heaviest snow in January? That's what I want to know.

<h3>Look at the dataset</h3>
          <div id = "text2">
		  <p>
		  	Here are the data I collected from <a href= "https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/snow-and-ice/snowfall-extremes/" target="_blank">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration</a>. I collected all the snowfall and rainfall data in MA counties in January for the latest three years.

	</div>

<h4>What I'm going to do</h4>
<div id = "text3">
			<p>I would like to make an interactive map showing the snowfall on 3 - 6, January to compare different situations in different MA counties.
             <br />
               When hovering the map, it will show a bar/line chart of the snowfall in different counties of MA in January for the latest three years.  </p>


		  	 <p>
			<i>What I may cover:</i>
			<ul>
			<li>The forming process of the storm</li>
			<li>Dynamic snowfall change day by day</li>
			<li>What's the impact</li>
			<li>Rainfall data</li>
