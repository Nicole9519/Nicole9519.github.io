        <h1>IS AIRBNB REALLY THE PROBLEM?</h1>
        <h2> The new Airbnb regulation was supposed to ease the housing crunch in Boston. The data leaves room for doubt.</h2>
          
        <p>Earlier this year, the Boston City Council overwhelmingly approved tough new restrictions on short-term rentals offered by companies like Airbnb. Starting in 2019, Boston will restrict Airbnb hoping to control rising rents, following similar laws in New York, Miami, San Francisco and other big cities. The measure eliminates investor-owned units from the marketplace while allowing owner-occupied, two- and three-family homeowners to rent out their units year-round. Under the new law, homeowners have to register with the city and pay an annual fee to rent out entire unit that is either a host’s primary residence or is part of an owner-occupied two- or three-family building.  </p>
          
          
        <p> “There certainly is an affordable housing problem here.”experts say. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-04/home-cost-index-says-ouch-hong-kong-oh-canada-hello-dubai">a recent Bloomberg analysis</a>. The median one-bedroom rent in Boston is $2,300 a month, and the two-bedroom median is $2,700. Both are more than roughly twice the national medians of $1,185 for a one-bedroom and $1,422 for a two-bedroom.</p>

    
        <p> Supporters of the new regulations argue that rental prices have been driven up and the affordable housing reduced in Boston because some landlords turned long-term rentals into short-term rentals like Airbnb. In certain areas like Chinatown, residents have been fighting for a regulation for a long time. “It's become a huge industry that's actually eating up a lot of the housing in the city,” says Lydia Lowe, the executive director of the Chinatown Community Land Trust.</p>

        <h2>Is Airbnb overblown? </h2>
        <p>“In cities like New York and Boston, profits for Airbnb are significantly lower than many expect suggesting units are vacant more than expected,” said Arun Sundararajan, the author of “The Sharing Economy.”</p>
        
        <p>According to <a href = "https://www.airdna.co/market-data">AirDNA MarketMinder</a>, Airbnb hosts could earn $5,787 a month in Back Bay in September 2018, but in January they could just earn $2,007 a month and even $1,456 in Chinatown and the occupancy rate is just 50 percent and 34 percent, AirDNA reported. People would think twice before turning long-term rentals into short term, because of other cleaning, facility fees, and time-cost.</p>

         <p>Since 2000, rents in Boston kept climbing 2 to 3 percent every year, according to Ries,Inc. There’s no sign that Airbnb accelerates the rents increasing rate.</p>

        <p>While one standard deviation - the magnitude of the 0.627 coefficient on Airbnb density - increase in Airbnb listings is associated with rents going up by 0.4 percent, “Airbnb is surely just a small part of it,” wrote author Mark Materan in <a href ="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137717300876">“Is home sharing driving up rents? Evidence from Airbnb in Boston”</a> in 2015.</p>

        <p>According to data collected between 2015 and 2018 by <a href = "http://insideairbnb.com/boston/?neighbourhood=Allston&filterEntireHomes=false&filterHighlyAvailable=false&filterRecentReviews=false&filterMultiListings=false">Airbnb Insider</a> -- an independent, data site -- there’s a little or no direct relationship between the increasing number of Airbnb and rising rents. As of late September, Airbnb listed 254 homes in Back Bay, 125 in Chinatown and 178 in East Boston, the rents in Back Bay only increased 1% while 11% in Chinatown and 8% in East Boston.  </p>

        <p>“The rent in Boston is determined by supply and demand,” said Materan, “supply like how much land can be developed and demand like how many jobs there are and how much money people can spend on rents really matter.“</p>

        <p>Being as an international center for higher learning, Boston is the location for 35 colleges, universities, and community colleges and annually, an influx of 95,824 students are housed off campus. Among them, 36,284 students housed in Boston, according to a municipal study.</p>

        <p>“Boston is such a city that has been built to attract people to come in, like lots of universities and major companies, and its house is not affordable at all for a long time, not just because of us,” Lucian Estevez said, who started his work in Bulfinch Realty as an Airbnb host in 2016.</p>

        <p>In this regard, the rising rents in long-popular neighborhoods in Boston also pushed younger renters out to towns far away from the downtown area where they, in turn, are also driving up prices. That’s why rents increased far faster in neighborhoods such as Dorchester and Mattapan than in areas closer to downtown.</p>

        <p>Though the city is trying to create more affordable housing, demand for affordable housing still far outstrips supply. In September, Mayor Martin J. Walsh's office released a revised version of its report, "Housing A Changing City: Boston 2030," which  increases the city's goal for new housing creation to 69,000 units by 2030, up from its original goal in 2014 of 53,000 units. </p>

      
        <p>“There are other pieces we should be talking about and not in silos,” said Boston City Council President Andrea Campbell. </p>

        <p>Lucian runs four Airbnb listings. He said he began his business in 2016, seeing the potential opportunity brought by the gig economy. “Airbnb is a much more effective way for people to rent their apartments to strangers,” said Lucian, ”and it also a good way for tourists to explore the authenticity of districts. ”  </p>

        <p>After being an Airbnb host, Lucian’s revenue doubled, especially from late May to early October, the most attractive season in Boston. “The city should be looking to just levy us the hospitality tax, like they do to any hotels and use the revenue to create more housing, which was one of the issues or one of the reasons for this new law,”he said, “but this is a free market.”</p>

        <p>The competition between Airbnb and traditional hotels is intensifying. <a href = "https://www.nber.org/papers/w24361">A paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research</a> shows that in the 10 cities with the largest Airbnb market share in the US, the entry of Airbnb resulted in 1.3 percent fewer hotel nights booked and a 1.5 percent loss in hotel revenue. During the summer in Boston, the average hotel price is more than $300, while Airbnb offers more apartments in the different price ranges, according to Greater Boston Convention & Visitor Bureau. “The government is actually helping the hotel industry.” said Lucian.</p>

        <p>Though the new Boston Airbnb regulation is aimed at eliminating the deep-pocket investor, the changes could be also hard on some small Airbnb hosts, who are nevertheless affected by the regulations. “My short-term rentals are my retirement income, augment my long-term care assisted living insurance, and allow me to continue living in a neighborhood that I have been supporting and creating, since I first moved here in 1978,” said Edward LeMay, who has been an Airbnb host since 2013 and has since had over 1,000 bookings.  </p>

        <h2>The backlash against Airbnb are spreading</h2>
        <p>Since Airbnb first launched in 2008 in San Francisco, it spreads aggressively in lots of major cities in America and shows no sign of slowing down. In 2006, there are 46000 Airbnb listings in New York and 26000 in Los Angeles, rising into the top ten cities with the highest number of Airbnb properties available. 

        <p>As a growing chorus is arguing that Airbnb turned lots of long-term rentals into short- term rentals, which driving up rental prices for city residents, San Francisco, New York and a host of other pricey cities are implementing or considering regulations.</p>

        <p>San Francisco is one of the priciest cities in the U.S. and began to limited Airbnb in February 2015, the city passed the law that hosts present during home-stays can lease rooms year round and require them to be registered. However, rents kept going up and hit a $4500 threshold. Population growth in San Francisco due to the tech industry and difficult process to get new housing approved are two main reasons for its high rental price.</p>

        <br/><br/>


        <p>Although rents in San Francisco in 2017 dropped for the first time in seven years, “It’s that folks have gotten so frustrated and fed up with finding an affordable place to live that they’ve moved on.” said Nathan Ho, senior director of housing and community development for the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, who take this decline as a more serious alarm. </p>

        <p>Another California community, Santa Monica, instituted the toughest regulation on short-term rentals in the U.S. in 2015. That regulation requires anyone putting a listing on Airbnb in Santa Monica to live on the property during the renter’s stay, register for a business license and collect a 14 percent occupancy tax from users that will be payable to the city.</p>
        <p>The city estimates that this will shut down about 1,400 of the 1,700 short-term rental listings in this upscale beach town and major tourist destination, according to a Forbes report. However, rent isn’t slowing down in Santa Monica and still keep rocketing. </p>
        <iframe id="datawrapper-chart-UkECm" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UkECm/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">if("undefined"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper["UkECm"]={},window.datawrapper["UkECm"].embedDeltas={"100":467,"200":425,"300":400,"400":400,"500":400,"700":400,"800":400,"900":400,"1000":400},window.datawrapper["UkECm"].iframe=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-UkECm"),window.datawrapper["UkECm"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper["UkECm"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper["UkECm"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+"px",window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if("undefined"!=typeof a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var b in a.data["datawrapper-height"])if("UkECm"==b)window.datawrapper["UkECm"].iframe.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"});</script>
          
          <p>Though the Airbnb rules went into effect in many cities, there’s little evidence showing that the decrease of Airbnb listings could cool down the rents, not even stall the increase of rents. We should still hold a conservative opinion on whether the new regulation in boston will help with the rental crunch or not. </p>

          <p>The crisis of housing affordability and availability in Boston that has enormous impact on individuals and families. Though the investor units may be reduced after the new Airbnb regulations go into effect, there’s no guarantee that these units are going to become affordable. It remains to be seen if the rules will have their intended effect.</p>
